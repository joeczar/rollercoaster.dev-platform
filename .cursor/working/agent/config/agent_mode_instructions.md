# Agent Mode Instructions for Handling Nuxt SSR Testing and File Access

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for the AI agent to:
- Verify that the Nuxt SSR setup is working correctly.
- Confirm that critical UI components (such as the Shadcn button) are rendered as expected.
- Handle file access within the `.cursor` workspace and execute tests to verify system behavior.

## Goals
- **Test the Nuxt SSR Setup:**  
  Verify that the homepage renders properly with SSR, Tailwind CSS is applied, and the Shadcn button is present.

- **File Access Management:**  
  Ensure the agent can read and update files in the `.cursor` directoryâ€”especially the test files and task documents.

## File Structure
- **Test File:** `tests/nuxt.test.js`
  - Contains tests for:
    - Basic HTML/SSR rendering.
    - Presence of Tailwind CSS classes.
    - Rendering of a Shadcn button.
- **Agent Configuration Directory:** `.cursor/working/agent/config/`
  - This document is stored here to ensure the agent can refer to it.

## Running the Tests
1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
     ```bash
     npm install @nuxt/test-utils --save-dev
     npm install vitest --save-dev
     ```
2. **Test Script:**
   - Add or verify the test script in `package.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "scripts": {
         "test:unit": "vitest"
       }
     }
     ```
3. **Execution:**
   - Run the tests by executing:
     ```bash
     npm run test:unit
     ```
4. **Expected Results:**
   - **Homepage renders successfully:**  
     Confirms that a valid HTML structure (with `<!DOCTYPE html>`) is returned.
   - **Tailwind CSS appears to be applied:**  
     Checks for classes matching `text-` to confirm Tailwind CSS is active.
   - **Shadcn Button renders correctly:**  
     Verifies that a `<button>` with the text "Shadcn Button" is present in the HTML.

## Troubleshooting Guidelines
- **Shadcn Button Not Found:**
  - Verify that your homepage includes the Shadcn button component.
  - If the button text differs, update the regex in `tests/nuxt.test.js` accordingly.
  
- **SSR or Tailwind Test Failures:**
  - Check that the Nuxt app is configured correctly.
  - Make sure your dependencies and configurations in `nuxt.config.ts` are up to date.

- **File Access Issues:**
  - Confirm that file permissions and paths in `.cursor` are correctly set.
  - Use explicit file commands (open, edit, etc.) as defined in prior agent instructions.

## Agent Behavior Instructions
- **Context Switching:**  
  When test results are available, if a test fails, update the task file with error details and suggest corrective actions.
  
- **Reporting Results:**  
  Present clear summaries of:
  - Success or failure of each test.
  - Next steps for remediation if any issues are detected.
  
- **Maintaining State:**  
  Continuously update this instruction document if new requirements or troubleshooting steps emerge.

By following these instructions, the agent can autonomously handle the verification of the Nuxt SSR setup and manage related file operations effectively.
