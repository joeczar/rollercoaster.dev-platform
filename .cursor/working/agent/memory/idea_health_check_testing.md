# Health Check and Automated Testing for API Endpoints

## Description:
Establish a basic automated testing framework including health-check monitoring for our API endpoints early in the development process to catch issues quickly.

## Origin:
Derived from the development plan review suggesting that, along with API setup, implementing testing early can mitigate issues as the project evolves.

## Potential Value:
Ensures reliability and robustness of API endpoints, promotes early detection of errors, and maintains stability during rapid development.
