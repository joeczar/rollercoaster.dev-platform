# Open Badges Server Research and Evaluation

## Description:
Conduct research to evaluate existing Open Badges v3 server options and create a pros/cons decision matrix to determine the best server for our needs.

## Origin:
Derived from the development plan review where incorporating an adapter pattern for badge server integration was suggested, with an emphasis on selecting the best server option.

## Potential Value:
Provides a clear understanding of available Open Badges servers, helps make an informed decision, and facilitates smoother integration with a well-suited server.
