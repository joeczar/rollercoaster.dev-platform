# Monorepo vs Separate Apps Analysis

## Current Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3 application using PNPM
- **Backend**: Bun with Hono server
- **Shared**: Common code/types between frontend and backend
- **Development**: `scripts/dev.sh` for running both concurrently

## Integration Points
- Shared types for badges and other entities
- Docker Compose for production deployment
- Development script to run both concurrently

## Option 1: Keep Separate Apps (Current)

### Advantages
- **Runtime Optimization**: Each app uses its most compatible runtime
  - Backend leverages Bun's speed and simplicity
  - Frontend avoids Bun's compatibility issues with Nuxt
- **Independent Development**: Teams can work on each app independently
- **Independent Versioning**: Each app can be versioned separately
- **Simplicity**: No need to set up complex monorepo tooling

### Disadvantages
- **Dependency Duplication**: TypeScript and other shared dependencies duplicated
- **Development Complexity**: Need separate terminal windows or custom scripts
- **Code Sharing Challenges**: Manual syncing of shared code between projects
- **CI/CD Complexity**: Multiple pipelines to maintain

## Option 2: Monorepo with PNPM

### Advantages
- **Unified Dependencies**: Single source of truth for all dependencies
- **Efficient Workspace Management**: PNPM's efficient disk space usage
- **Better Code Sharing**: Easier to share code between projects
- **Simplified Development**: Single command to run everything
- **Atomic Changes**: Changes across projects can be committed together
- **Consistent Tooling**: Same linting, formatting, testing across all projects

### Disadvantages
- **Loss of Bun Performance**: Backend would lose Bun's performance benefits
- **Migration Effort**: Requires initial setup and configuration
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand monorepo concepts
- **Build Complexity**: May need additional tools like Turborepo

## Performance Analysis

### Package Management
- **Bun**: Much faster package installation (8-10s vs 19-20s on macOS)
- **PNPM**: Still faster than NPM/Yarn, excellent disk space efficiency
- **For CI**: Bun shows ~52s advantage over PNPM/Yarn on Linux

### Runtime Performance
- **Bun**: Significantly faster for backend services
- **Node/PNPM**: Better compatibility with complex frameworks like Nuxt

## Implementation Complexity

### Converting to Monorepo
1. Create root `package.json` with workspaces
2. Convert backend from Bun to Node.js
3. Migrate backend dependencies to PNPM
4. Create workspace for shared code
5. Update import paths
6. Implement build scripts with dependencies

### Estimated Effort: Medium (1-2 days)

## Recommendation

**Keep the current separate app structure** but make improvements:

1. **Formalize Shared Code**:
   - Create proper package for shared types with its own versioning
   - Use Git submodules or npm package for sharing

2. **Improve Development Experience**:
   - Enhance the existing dev script for better DX
   - Add restart and watching capabilities

3. **Rationale**:
   - Bun's performance benefits for the backend are significant
   - Nuxt 3 has compatibility issues with Bun (as confirmed by our tests)
   - Current codebase is relatively small, so duplication costs are minimal
   - Separate apps allow optimizing each stack independently

## Future Considerations

1. **Re-evaluate when**:
   - Project grows significantly in size and complexity
   - Bun matures and resolves Nuxt compatibility issues
   - Team size increases and coordination becomes harder

2. **Possible hybrid approach**:
   - Keep Bun for backend but set up proper PNPM workspaces
   - Use package.json scripts at root to orchestrate development

## Further Research Needed

1. Performance benchmarks specific to our app
2. Impact on CI/CD pipeline
3. Team preferences and experience with monorepo structure
