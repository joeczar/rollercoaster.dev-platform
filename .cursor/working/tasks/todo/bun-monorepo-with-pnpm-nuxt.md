# Bun Monorepo with PNPM-Powered Nuxt App

## Research Summary

Based on my research, using Bun for monorepo management while running Nuxt with PNPM is **not recommended** due to several compatibility issues and limitations:

1. **Nuxt-Bun Compatibility Issues**: As we discovered earlier, Nuxt has compatibility issues with Bun, especially related to file watching and FSEvents on macOS.

2. **Conflicting Package Management**: Using two different package managers (Bun for monorepo, PNPM for Nuxt) creates complexity and potential conflicts in dependency resolution.

3. **Limited Documentation/Examples**: There are few examples of this specific configuration, suggesting it's not a common or well-supported approach.

## Main Concerns

### 1. Dependency Resolution Conflicts

- Bun and PNPM handle workspace dependencies differently
- Cross-package dependencies become especially problematic when two package managers are involved
- Risk of duplicate dependencies or version conflicts

### 2. Nuxt-Specific Workflows

- Nuxt works well with PNPM workspaces and has documented patterns for monorepo setups
- Nuxt Layers, a powerful feature for monorepos, is designed to work with PNPM workspaces
- Breaking this established pattern may lead to unexpected issues

### 3. Runtime Environment Inconsistencies

- Using Bun to manage dependencies but Node.js (via PNPM) to run Nuxt creates an inconsistent runtime environment
- Development vs. production differences could lead to difficult-to-debug issues

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. PNPM Monorepo with Nuxt (Recommended)

Instead of using Bun for monorepo management, the most established and well-documented approach is:

- Use PNPM workspaces for the entire monorepo
- Run the backend with Bun (through scripts that explicitly call Bun)
- Run the frontend (Nuxt) with PNPM

This approach is documented in multiple resources and has proven successful.

### 2. Hybrid Approach (Medium Complexity)

If Bun monorepo management is desired:

- Use Bun workspaces for package management
- Create explicit scripts that delegate to PNPM for running Nuxt
- Carefully manage shared dependencies and consider using helper scripts to ensure proper package linking

## Implementation Complexity

Using Bun for monorepo management while running Nuxt with PNPM would require:

1. Setting up Bun workspaces at the root
2. Configuring PNPM to run only within the Nuxt directory
3. Creating helper scripts to handle the complexity of multi-package-manager workflows
4. Careful management of shared dependencies
5. Potential custom build processes

Estimated effort: High (3-5 days), with ongoing maintenance complexity.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

Based on the research and the current state of tools, I would **strongly recommend against** using Bun for monorepo management while running Nuxt with PNPM. 

The most reliable approach is:

1. **Use PNPM workspaces** for the entire monorepo
2. **Create scripts** that explicitly call Bun for running the backend
3. **Use PNPM** for running Nuxt

This approach:
- Follows established patterns with good documentation
- Minimizes configuration complexity
- Avoids dependency resolution conflicts
- Leverages the strengths of both tools without forcing them to interact in problematic ways
