# Plan: Improve Current Structure Without Full Monorepo

## Current State
- Two separate applications (frontend/backend)
- Shared types directory for cross-app type definitions
- Basic development script for running both apps
- Basic Docker Compose setup for production

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Formalize Shared Code Package

#### Step 1: Restructure Shared Directory
```
shared/
├── index.ts          # Main entry point exporting all shared code
├── package.json      # Package definition for shared code
├── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript config for shared code
└── types/
    ├── badge.ts      # Existing badge types 
    ├── index.ts      # Type exports
    └── ...           # Other type definitions
```

#### Step 2: Create Proper Package Definition
- Create package.json for shared code with proper versioning
- Set up dependencies and build scripts
- Configure TypeScript for better type compatibility

#### Step 3: Reference Shared Package in Apps
- Update frontend and backend to import from shared package
- Ensure types are properly resolved

### 2. Improve Development Experience

#### Step 1: Enhance Development Script
- Improve current dev.sh script with better error handling
- Add restart capabilities
- Add better logging and status information

#### Step 2: Add Convenience Scripts
- Create scripts for common development tasks
- Add scripts for testing, building, and deployment

### 3. Streamline Dependencies

#### Step 1: Audit Common Dependencies
- Identify duplicate dependencies between frontend and backend
- Move common dev dependencies to appropriate places

#### Step 2: Standardize TypeScript Config
- Create consistent TypeScript configuration between projects
- Improve path mapping and type resolution

## Expected Outcome
- Better organized shared code with proper versioning
- Improved developer experience
- Maintained performance benefits of current structure
- Foundation for potential future monorepo conversion
