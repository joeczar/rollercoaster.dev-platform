# Continue Shared Code Migration

## Description
Continue the work on migrating and improving the shared code structure by focusing on updating existing imports, moving more common code to the shared package, and improving the build pipeline.

## Subtasks

### 1. Update Remaining Imports (30-45 minutes)
- [ ] Identify all imports in frontend that need to be updated to use the shared package
- [ ] Identify all imports in backend that need to be updated to use the shared package
- [ ] Update imports using a consistent pattern 
- [ ] Test that all imports work correctly

### 2. Move Common Utilities to Shared Package (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Identify common utilities that exist in both frontend and backend
- [ ] Move these utilities to the shared package
- [ ] Update imports in frontend and backend to use the shared versions
- [ ] Test that the utilities work correctly when imported from shared

### 3. Implement Shared Validation Logic (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Identify validation logic that exists in both frontend and backend
- [ ] Create a validation module in the shared package
- [ ] Move validation logic to the shared module
- [ ] Update frontend and backend to use the shared validation

### 4. Improve CI/CD Pipeline (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Update build scripts to properly handle the shared package
- [ ] Add proper versioning for the shared package
- [ ] Set up proper publishing workflow for the shared package
- [ ] Test the build pipeline with the new structure

## Expected Outcome
- All imports in frontend and backend will use the shared package
- Common utilities and validation logic will be moved to the shared package
- CI/CD pipeline will properly handle the shared package
