# Fullstack Development Setup: Bun + Hono + Vue

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:**  
  Create a streamlined fullstack development environment with Bun, Hono backend and Vue 3 frontend with shared types, easy-to-use scripts, and proper project structure
- **Energy Level Required:** Medium ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹
- **Current Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## 2. Resources Inventory
- **Existing Tools/Files:**  
  - frontend/pages/editor.vue (initial mockup)
  - color_and_accessibility_rule.mdc
  - components_development_rule.mdc
- **Additional Needs:**  
  - Bun runtime
  - Hono web framework
  - TypeScript for shared types
  - SQLite or similar for database
  - Dev environment scripts
- **Related Files:**  
  - To be created:
    - backend/index.ts (main entry point)
    - backend/controllers/*.ts (API route handlers)
    - shared/types/*.ts (shared type definitions)
    - frontend/services/*.ts (API client layer)
    - scripts/*.sh (dev environment scripts)

## 3. Initial Ideas & Brainstorming
- **Ideas:**  
  - Use Bun's built-in SQLite support for simple data persistence
  - Create a dev container for consistent environment
  - Implement hot reloading for both frontend and backend
  - Share types between frontend and backend for type safety
  - Add combined start script to run both in development
- **Potential Challenges:**  
  - Ensuring proper type sharing between frontend and backend
  - Setting up efficient hot reloading for development
  - Balancing simplicity with scalability for future growth
- **Decision Log:**
  - Decision: Use Bun + Hono for backend
  - Reasoning: Fast runtime, lightweight framework, good TypeScript support
  - Alternatives Considered: Express.js, Fastify, NestJS (more complex)

## 4. Preliminary Plan
- **Quick Wins:**
  - [ ] Create basic project structure with frontend/backend/shared folders (10 mins)
  - [ ] Initialize package.json files for root and backend (10 mins)
  - [ ] Set up tsconfig.json files for proper TypeScript configuration (15 mins)
- **Major Steps:**  
  1. Backend Setup: Create Bun + Hono API scaffold (2 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - Install Bun and initialize project
     - Set up Hono with TypeScript
     - Create basic API endpoints for badges
  2. Frontend Integration: Implement API service layer (1.5 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - Create service directory structure
     - Implement typed API clients
     - Update frontend components to use API services
  3. Shared Types: Define shared TypeScript interfaces (1 hour) ðŸŽ¯
     - Create Badge and other entity interfaces
     - Set up proper import paths
     - Ensure types are accessible to both frontend and backend
  4. Development Environment: Configure dev scripts and tools (2 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - Create scripts to run frontend and backend concurrently
     - Set up hot reloading for both
     - Add optional dev container configuration

## 5. Execution Tracker
- **Progress Updates:**  
  - [ ] Project Structure: Created outline of needed directories and files
  - [ ] Backend Research: Identified Bun + Hono as optimal solution
  - [ ] Frontend Assessment: Reviewed current Vue implementation and integration points
- **Context Resume Point:**
  Last working on: Planning fullstack architecture
  Next planned action: Create project structure and initialize backend
  Current blockers: None

## 6. Immediate Next Actions & Blockers
- **Next Actions:** 
  - [ ] Create project directory structure (15 mins)
  - [ ] Initialize backend with Bun and install Hono (30 mins)
  - [ ] Create a simple "Hello World" API endpoint (30 mins)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - None currently identified

## 7. Reflections
- **Observations:**  
  Current mockup provides good frontend foundation but lacks backend integration. A proper fullstack setup will accelerate development and improve maintainability.
- **Celebration Notes:** ðŸŽ‰
  - Successfully identified optimal tech stack for our needs
  - Created detailed architecture plan for fullstack implementation
  - Broke down complex setup into manageable steps
