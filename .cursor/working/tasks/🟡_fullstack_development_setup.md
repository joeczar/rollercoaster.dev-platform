# Fullstack Development Setup: Bun + Hono + Vue

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:**  
  Create a streamlined fullstack development environment with Bun, Hono backend and Vue 3 frontend with shared types, easy-to-use scripts, and proper project structure
- **Energy Level Required:** Medium ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹
- **Current Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## 2. Resources Inventory
- **Existing Tools/Files:**  
  - frontend/pages/editor.vue (initial mockup)
  - color_and_accessibility_rule.mdc
  - components_development_rule.mdc
- **Additional Needs:**  
  - Bun runtime
  - Hono web framework
  - TypeScript for shared types
  - SQLite or similar for database
  - Dev environment scripts
- **Related Files:**  
  - Created:
    - backend/src/routes/badges.ts (API endpoints for badges)
    - shared/types/badge.ts (shared type definitions)
    - frontend/services/badgeService.ts (API client layer)
    - scripts/dev.sh (development environment script)

## 3. Initial Ideas & Brainstorming
- **Ideas:**  
  - Use Bun's built-in SQLite support for simple data persistence
  - Create a dev container for consistent environment
  - Implement hot reloading for both frontend and backend
  - Share types between frontend and backend for type safety
  - Add combined start script to run both in development
- **Potential Challenges:**  
  - Ensuring proper type sharing between frontend and backend
  - Setting up efficient hot reloading for development
  - Balancing simplicity with scalability for future growth
- **Decision Log:**
  - Decision: Use Bun + Hono for backend
  - Reasoning: Fast runtime, lightweight framework, good TypeScript support
  - Alternatives Considered: Express.js, Fastify, NestJS (more complex)

## 4. Preliminary Plan
- **Quick Wins:**
  - [x] Create basic project structure with frontend/backend/shared folders (10 mins)
  - [x] Initialize package.json files for root and backend (10 mins)
  - [x] Set up tsconfig.json files for proper TypeScript configuration (15 mins)
- **Major Steps:**  
  1. Backend Setup: Create Bun + Hono API scaffold (2 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - [x] Install Bun and initialize project
     - [x] Set up Hono with TypeScript
     - [x] Create basic API endpoints for badges
  2. Frontend Integration: Implement API service layer (1.5 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - [x] Create service directory structure
     - [x] Implement typed API clients
     - [ ] Update frontend components to use API services
  3. Shared Types: Define shared TypeScript interfaces (1 hour) ðŸŽ¯
     - [x] Create Badge and other entity interfaces
     - [x] Set up proper import paths
     - [x] Ensure types are accessible to both frontend and backend
  4. Development Environment: Configure dev scripts and tools (2 hours) ðŸŽ¯
     - [x] Create scripts to run frontend and backend concurrently
     - [x] Set up hot reloading for both
     - [ ] Add optional dev container configuration

## 5. Execution Tracker
- **Progress Updates:**  
  - [x] Project Structure: Created shared directory and updated backend structure
  - [x] Badge API: Implemented CRUD endpoints for badges in backend
  - [x] Frontend Service: Created badgeService for API integration
  - [x] Dev Script: Created dev.sh to run frontend and backend concurrently
- **Context Resume Point:**
  Last working on: scripts/dev.sh (development environment script)
  Next planned action: Test the development environment setup
  Current blockers: None

## 6. Immediate Next Actions & Blockers
- **Next Actions:** 
  - [ ] Test the development environment by running scripts/dev.sh (15 mins)
  - [ ] Update one frontend component to use the badge service (30 mins)
  - [ ] Document the API endpoints and integration points (30 mins)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - None currently identified

## 7. Reflections
- **Observations:**  
  The existing project structure was more complete than initially expected, which accelerated our progress. The backend already had Hono installed and a basic structure set up.
- **Celebration Notes:** ðŸŽ‰
  - Successfully implemented Badge API endpoints with proper typing
  - Created a shared type system between frontend and backend
  - Set up a convenient development script for running both services
