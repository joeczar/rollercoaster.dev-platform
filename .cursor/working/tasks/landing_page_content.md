# Landing Page Content Outline for rollercoaster.dev

## 1. Headline / Hero Section

**"Rollercoaster.dev is a space where neurodivergent minds create and discover tools designed for the way we think."**

## 2. "What We're Building" Section

At Rollercoaster.dev, we're crafting a unique platform centered around **Open Badges**, designed specifically for the neurodivergent experience.

Imagine a place where you can:

*   **Track and showcase progress** on *any* goal that matters to you – learning, work, hobbies, community action, personal growth, and more.
*   **Visualize your journey** and achievements in meaningful ways.
*   **Easily pause and restart** your activities, with support to pick things back up, especially during challenging times like burnout or low motivation.
*   **Connect with a community** for validation, shared learning, and mutual support.

We believe this system can empower neurodivergent individuals to navigate their goals, document their unique paths, and build confidence along the way.

## 3. "Our Vision & Goals" Section

**Our Vision: Tools Built From Lived Experience**

Standard productivity tools often fall short for neurodivergent individuals. Rigid schedules and linear lists don't always align with how our minds work best. We understand that neurodivergent strengths are different, and navigating goals requires tools that offer flexibility, clear steps, and genuine understanding – not just another calendar.

At Rollercoaster.dev, our vision is simple: **Create the tools we wish existed, built *by* and *for* the neurodivergent community.**

Our goals are:

*   **To empower users** by breaking down overwhelming goals into manageable, actionable steps.
*   **To offer flexibility**, allowing individuals to pursue their objectives in a way that adapts to their fluctuating energy and focus, free from rigid timelines.
*   **To foster a community** built on shared understanding and mutual support, where connecting with others who navigate similar challenges helps everyone grow – because we know the power of shared stories and truly 'getting it'.

We're building this because we understand the need firsthand. It's about creating solutions that embrace and support the diverse ways neurodivergent minds thrive.

## 4. "Rough Roadmap" Section

**Where We Are & Where We're Going**

Our journey is underway! Here's a glimpse of our progress and planned next steps:

1.  **Core Engine (Near Completion - Alpha):** We're finalizing the backend API (`bun-badges`) and shared data structures (`openbadges-types`) based on the Open Badges standard. These form the foundation of the platform.
    *   *See progress: [`bun-badges`](https://github.com/rollercoaster-dev/bun-badges), [`openbadges-types`](https://github.com/rollercoaster-dev/openbadges-types)*
2.  **Building Blocks (Next Up):** Development will begin on a library of reusable interface components (Vue) specifically for interacting with Open Badges.
3.  **The Platform (Planned):** Bringing it all together into an intuitive workspace (`badges.rollercoaster.dev`) where users can manage, visualize, and share their badges and learning journeys.
4.  **Community & Growth (Ongoing/Future):** We're actively seeking neurodivergent collaborators to join the development and design effort. Following the initial build, we'll focus on securing funding and initiating testing phases.

We're excited about building this incrementally and transparently with the community.
