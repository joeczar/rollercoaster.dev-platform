# Next Steps for Vue 3 SSR Setup

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:**  
  Complete the full Vue 3 SSR setup with all required features from setup.md
- **Energy Level Required:** Medium ðŸ”‹
- **Current Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## 2. Resources Inventory
- **Existing Tools/Files:**  
  - Basic Nuxt setup with Tailwind
  - shadcn-vue integration
  - Dark mode support
- **Additional Needs:**

  - unplugin-vue-components for auto-importing components
  - unplugin-vue-router for auto-generated routes

## 3. Initial Ideas & Brainstorming
- **Ideas:**  
  - Set up auto-imports first as they affect DX the most
  - Create test components to verify auto-imports
  - Set up route structure for testing
- **Potential Challenges:**  
  - Potential conflicts between shadcn and auto-imports
  - Need to ensure SSR compatibility with all plugins
- **Decision Log:**
  - Decision: Start with auto-imports
  - Reasoning: Improves development experience immediately
  - Alternatives Considered: Starting with routing (but imports affect all components)
