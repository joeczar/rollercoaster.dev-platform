# fix_better_sqlite3_error.md

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:** Resolve the "Cannot locate bindings file" error for better-sqlite3 with minimal intrusion.
- **Energy Level Required:** Medium ðŸ”‹

## 2. Resources Inventory
- **Existing Tools/Files:**
  - package.json, node_modules, pnpm lock file
  - Nuxt Content (which relies on better-sqlite3)

## 3. Initial Ideas & Brainstorming
- **Idea 1 (Least Intrusive):** Delete the node_modules folder and reinstall dependencies.
- **Idea 2:** Run a rebuild for better-sqlite3 (using "pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3").
- **Idea 3 (More Intrusive):** Remove better-sqlite3 and reinstall a compatible version.

## 4. Preliminary Plan
- **Quick Wins:**
  - [ ] Delete node_modules and run a fresh installation. (Approx. 5 mins)
  - [ ] If the error persists, attempt to rebuild better-sqlite3. (Approx. 5 mins)
  - [ ] If still unresolved, consider removing and reinstalling better-sqlite3 manually. (Further investigation required)

## 5. Execution Tracker
- **Step 1:** Delete node_modules folder.
- **Step 2:** Reinstall all dependencies.
- **Step 3:** Test the Nuxt dev server to see if the error is resolved.
- **Step 4:** If the error remains, run "pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3" and retest.

## 6. Immediate Next Actions & Blockers
- **Next Actions:**
  - Delete node_modules folder (least intrusive step).
  - Run "pnpm install" afterward.
- **Potential Blockers:**
  - System environment issues or missing build tools.

## 7. Reflections
- Document outcomes and errors at each step.
- Only escalate to more intrusive measures if the initial steps fail.
