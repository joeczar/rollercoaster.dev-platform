 # Node Modules: Strict No-Edit Policy

## Core Rule
**NEVER** modify, patch, or directly edit anything in the `node_modules` directory under any circumstances.

## Rationale
1. Changes to `node_modules` are:
   - Temporary and lost on next install
   - Not tracked in version control
   - Dangerous and unpredictable
   - Against Node.js package management best practices

## What To Do Instead
When encountering dependency issues:
1. Update dependencies in package.json
2. Use proper dependency resolution in package.json
3. Find alternative packages if needed
4. Report issues to package maintainers
5. Fork packages properly if absolutely necessary

## Examples

### ❌ NEVER DO:
- Edit files in node_modules directly
- Create patches for node_modules files
- Suggest manual fixes to node_modules
- Try to override node_modules behavior through direct modification

### ✅ DO INSTEAD:
- Update package versions
- Use proper dependency management
- Find compatible alternatives
- Fork and maintain separate packages
- Use proper package.json fields for resolution

## Enforcement
This rule is absolute and has no exceptions. Any suggestion to modify node_modules should be immediately rejected.
