# Storybook Styles Not Applied

## Error Description
- Styles defined in Vue components are not being applied in Storybook
- Components are rendering but appear unstyled
- CSS classes are present but styles are not taking effect

## Recent Changes
- Successfully fixed component compilation issues
- Moved from startup errors to styling issues
- Components are now rendering structurally

## Potentially Involved Files
1. `.storybook/main.ts` - Storybook configuration
2. `.storybook/preview.ts` - Storybook preview configuration
3. `frontend/components/**/*.vue` - Component style blocks
4. `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration
5. `assets/css/` - Any global CSS files

## Current State
✅ Working:
- Components render structurally
- Template syntax is processed
- Component logic (computed properties) works

❌ Not Working:
- Scoped styles not applying
- CSS variables not resolving
- Tailwind classes not working

## Investigation Plan
1. Check if Storybook is configured to handle Vue SFC styles
2. Verify Tailwind integration in Storybook
3. Check CSS variable injection
4. Examine style preprocessing setup

## Hypothesis
Primary suspects:
1. Missing style loader configuration in Storybook
2. Tailwind not properly integrated with Storybook
3. CSS variables not being injected into Storybook environment

## Proposed Debug Steps
1. Examine `.storybook/main.ts` for style handling configuration
2. Check for global style imports in `.storybook/preview.ts`
3. Verify Tailwind PostCSS configuration
4. Test with inline styles to isolate the issue
5. Add CSS debugging statements

## Success Criteria
- Scoped styles from components are applied
- Tailwind classes work as expected
- CSS variables resolve correctly
- Theme switching functions properly
